# GettingAndCleaningData
This repository contains the Coursera Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones]
(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files
The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

The zip file can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

Alternatively, the commented codes in run_analysis.R from line 7 through 12 can be uncommented to download and unzip data for the first time. 


`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` has code for performing analyses described in 5 steps. 

The output of the 5th step called `tidyDataSet.txt` is uploaded in the course project's form.
